# I regret it.

# Is it a Threat or Prevention?

I regret it dun sa mga taong tinulungan ko all about tech especially ethical hacking. They have my respect now for me simula nung naturuan ko na sila and i dont know kung nakabuti ba sa mga ibang tao. I know, they become a great hackers but there is someone isnt playing safe. From teaching the basic OSINT to breaking the system ethically, they might earned the respect to me. 

I have the dilemma from this question:
Is someone Threatening me or Preventing me to get exploited or hurt my physical and emotional feelings?

I think dun sa issue ng ex ko ay parang nag aalign sa nalalaman ko. Im sorry but i have to hear my intrusive thoughts.
What if may tama talaga yung ginawa nila para malaman ko yung totoo?
And my another question is: What if setup pala to para sa akin at gusto akong i let down?
